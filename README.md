## Minimum image convention for hexagonal 2D lattice

The following directory contains two programs for calculating minimum distances for 2D hexagonal lattice by using minimum image convention algorithm. The two programs are:
* FORTRAN90 program  `MinimumImage.f90`
* Python program `MinimumImage.py`

Given the two basis vector of the hexagonal lattice, the algorithm projects the Euclidean distance between the two particles into the two basis vectors, then classical minimum image is applied.
